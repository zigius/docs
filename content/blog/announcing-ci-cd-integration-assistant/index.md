We are excited to announce the launch of the integration assistant features to help make integration with CI/CD easy.
By using the integration assistant you can easily get started with popular CI/CD services without the hassle of
initial setup.

Teams often want to setup CI/CD automation for their stacks but don't want to go through the hassle of figuring out
how to get started with a workflow that works and where to configure pipeline settings. The integration assistant not only
gives you easy-to-follow instructions based on the CI/CD service, but also provides customized pipeline configuration for
popular CI/CD services that you can add to your VCS repo.

### What's a VCS?

A VCS is a version control system. You may already be familiar with Git-based services such as Atlassian Bitbucket,
GitHub, GitLab. Adding your code to a central VCS allows you to secure your codebase against failures, as well as
team collaboration. Add an automated CI/CD pipeline on top of this and you have faster delivery for your services.

### A true assistant

The assistant also goes beyond helping you get started with a workflow. For the stacks in your organization, it helps you
track which of them have not yet been integrated with a VCS. The wizard in the Integrations option of your stack's
settings page will help you through the whole process of configuring a VCS to setting up a working automated pipeline.
No more copy/pasting random scripts from an old blog post!

You can [request](https://github.com/pulumi/ci-workflow-templates/issues/new/choose) support for a new CI/CD service too.
